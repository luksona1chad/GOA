<p>Shameless is an American comedy drama television series developed by John Wells that aired on Showtime from January 9, 2011, to April 11, 2021. It is an adaptation of Paul Abbott's British series of the same name and features an ensemble cast led by William H. Macy and Emmy Rossum. The series is set in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois.[1]</p>
<p>With the premiere of the ninth season on September 9, 2018, Shameless became the longest-running original-scripted series in Showtime's history.[2][3] In January 2019, the series was renewed for a tenth season, which premiered on November 10, 2019.[4][5][6] In January 2020, the series was renewed for its eleventh and final season, which was scheduled to premiere in mid-2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; </p>
<p> it instead premiered on December 6, 2020.[7] On December 14, 2020, Showtime announced that they were airing a clip show series during Season 11, titled Shameless: Hall of Shame, containing new scenes juxtaposed with clips from the show to summarize the characters' journeys during the prior 10 seasons.[8] The series finale aired on April 11, 2021.</p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<img src="https://www.serialminds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shameless03.jpg" alt="">
<p>The series depicts the poor, dysfunctional family of Frank Gallagher, a neglectful single father of six: Fiona, Phillip, Ian, Debbie, Carl, and Liam. He spends his days drunk, high, or in search of money, while his children need to learn to take care of themselves. </p>
<p>The show's producers sought to distinguish this production from previous American working-class shows by highlighting how Frank's alcohol and drug addiction affects his family.</p>

<h4>Filming</h4>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRSzHxOKNwLcCHHoSHkmMcSNMMipxyLYNx3uA&s" alt="">
<p>The series is mostly filmed at a Los Angeles studio, with some scenes filmed in Chicago.[23] Despite most of the filming being done in California, most of the houses and other notable locations can actually be found in the Southside of Chicago, Illinois.[24] Initial shooting of the second season began on July 5, 2011[25] and premiered January 8, 2012.[26] The series was renewed for a third season on February 1, 2012,[27] and initial shooting began June 27, 2012.[28] The third season premiered on January 13, 2013, and two weeks later on January 29, Shameless was renewed for a fourth season.[29] It premiered January 12, 2014. On February 18, 2014, the series was renewed for a fifth season.[30] Production on the first episode of the fifth season began on July 3, 2014 with the first episode table read,[31] with initial shooting for the season beginning on July 8, 2014.[32][33] The series was renewed for a sixth season on January 12, 2015.[34] Shameless was renewed for a 12-episode seventh season on January 12, 2016.[35] Season 7 premiered on October 2, 2016.</p>
<p>In December 2016 it was reported that Emmy Rossum, after multiple seasons of being paid significantly less than her co-star William H. Macy, requested that she be paid equally and compensated in future seasons to make up for the previous salary discrepancies. The equal pay negotiations, which were vocally supported by her co-star Macy,[36] briefly delayed work on an eighth season of the series while she and Warner Bros. Television negotiated. The dispute came to an end on December 14, when Rossum confirmed through Twitter that she would continue to work on the series, with production of an eighth season to begin in May 2017.[37] On December 19, 2016, Showtime officially announced that Shameless had been renewed for an eighth season.[38] Just days after the eighth season premiere, it was announced that the show had been renewed for a ninth, which would bring the show past the 100-episode mark.[39][40]</p>
<p>In August 2018, Rossum announced her departure from Shameless after nine seasons playing Fiona Gallagher.[41] In October 2018, Cameron Monaghan also announced his departure from the series after playing Ian Gallagher for nine seasons; however, it was later announced Monaghan was expected to return for the tenth season.[42]</p>
<p>On January 13, 2020, it was announced that the series had been renewed for its eleventh and final season, which had been scheduled to air in summer 2020 but was then delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Macy, White, Cutkosky, Hampton, Howey, Kenney, Monaghan, Fisher, Miner, and Isaiah would all return for the series' final season.[43] Production on the final season commenced on September 8, 2020.[44] Production for the final season ended on March 12, 2021.</p>
