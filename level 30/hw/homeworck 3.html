    <p>The boy Tanjirō Kamado grows up as the eldest son of a charcoal burner. In order to provide for his five younger siblings and his mother, he works particularly hard and even in the depths of winter goes from the forest to the city to sell coal. There, the hard-working boy is popular with many. But when he returns to his family's hut one day, they have all been victims of an attack. According to the tracks, they were the demons that the legends tell of and that eat people at night. Only Tanjirō's sister Nezuko is still warm, so he takes her with him on the way to the city. On the way, however, it turns out that she has also become a demon and thus a danger. They meet Giyū Tomioka, the pillar (柱 hashira , English 'pillar, pillar' , a "pillar" or hashira is an outstanding member of the corps of demon hunters) of water. He wants to kill Nezuko, but Tanjirō wants to protect his little sister. A fight ensues, in which Nezuko also protects her brother. Tomioka ultimately lets them both live and sends them to his master Sakonji Urokodaki.
        On the journey to Master Urokodaki, the siblings meet another demon against whom they must defend themselves, and against whom Nezuko once again protects her brother. She herself has to hide from sunlight during the day in order not to decay and not be recognized as a demon by humans. Once at Urokodaki's, Tanjirō begins his apprenticeship with him in order to become a demon hunter and one day be able to help his sister become human again. Finally, with the help of two spirits, he succeeds in completing his apprenticeship and passing the demon hunter test: surviving seven days and nights on Mount Fujikasane, which is populated by demons. In the end, only a few of the candidates survived, including the fearful Zenitsu Agatsuma and the confident Genya Shinazugawa. They are given a raven as a messenger, who accompanies them and tells them their tasks.</p>
