                <p>Georgia is a country located at the intersection of Europe and Asia. It has a rich history that spans
                    thousands of years, with its territory inhabited by ancient civilizations, including the Kingdom of
                    Colchis, known for its connection to Greek mythology. Georgia’s strategic location on the ancient
                    Silk Road made it a crossroads of various cultures, influences, and empires.</p>

                <p>Georgia is an ancient land with its roots deeply embedded in the ancient world. The ancient Colchis
                    Kingdom, mentioned in Greek mythology, and Iberia, the precursor to the modern Georgian state,
                    established Georgia as a key point on the map of world history. Its culture was shaped by a fusion
                    of Greek, Roman, Persian, and later, Ottoman and Russian influences.</p>

                <p>Over the centuries, Georgia faced numerous invasions, yet its people remained resilient, fiercely
                    preserving their identity, language, and Orthodox Christian faith. Georgia’s political and cultural
                    history is marked by its resistance against foreign empires and its remarkable contributions to art,
                    literature, and religion.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Georgia: The Kingdom of Colchis and Iberia</h2>

            <img src="https://georgia.to/media/thumbnails/VumDtPvrpBLbb9sfipnw3X_small.jpg" alt="" width="500">

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>The earliest evidence of human presence in Georgia dates back to the early Bronze Age. The Kingdom of
                    Colchis, which existed in the western part of modern Georgia, is mentioned in Greek mythology as the
                    land of the Golden Fleece, which was the object of the Argonauts' quest. The ancient Kingdom of
                    Iberia (modern eastern Georgia) played a central role in the development of Georgian culture,
                    especially during the period when it became a vassal of the Roman Empire.</p>

                <p>The Kingdom of Colchis flourished between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, and its role in regional
                    trade and culture was significant. The Greek historian Herodotus mentions the wealth of the
                    Colchians, their advanced metallurgy, and their contributions to the development of civilization. In
                    fact, the myth of Jason and the Argonauts is rooted in the Colchian region.</p>

                <p>Simultaneously, the Kingdom of Iberia (not to be confused with the Iberian Peninsula) developed as an
                    important political entity in the eastern part of modern Georgia. Iberia was initially a vassal of
                    Persia and later the Roman Empire, but it gradually became more independent and maintained its
                    sovereignty in the region. This period laid the foundation for modern Georgian identity, with its
                    distinct language, customs, and Orthodox Christianity.</p>

            <h2>Medieval Georgia: The Golden Age</h2>

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>During the medieval period, particularly under King David IV and Queen Tamar, Georgia reached the
                    peak of its power. This era is often referred to as Georgia’s Golden Age, characterized by military
                    victories, cultural flourishing, and the expansion of the Georgian kingdom. The period saw the
                    construction of grand churches and monasteries, as well as the flourishing of Georgian literature
                    and arts.</p>
                    
                <p>Under the reign of King David IV, known as "David the Builder," Georgia experienced a period of
                    unification, military victories, and economic growth. His policies restored Georgia's territorial
                    integrity and solidified its place as a regional power. Following his reign, Queen Tamar led Georgia
                    to further prosperity during the 12th and early 13th centuries. Her reign is often regarded as a
                    high point in Georgian history due to her diplomatic and military successes.</p>

                <p>Georgia’s Golden Age is also marked by the development of its distinct Georgian script and the
                    flourishing of Georgian literature. During this period, works of literature such as the "Knight in
                    the Panther's Skin" by Shota Rustaveli were written, cementing Georgia's place as a center of
                    cultural achievement in the medieval world. The Golden Age represents a time of cultural, political,
                    and military supremacy in Georgian history.</p>

            <h2>The Mongol Invasion and Decline of the Kingdom</h2>

            <img src="https://medievalprojectelijah.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/5/4/10547248/618723613.jpg" alt="" width="500">

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire invaded Georgia, leading to the fragmentation of the Georgian
                    Kingdom. Though Georgia managed to maintain some independence, its power was greatly diminished
                    during the subsequent centuries. The internal divisions and external pressures from neighboring
                    empires, including the Mongols and Timurids, weakened Georgia’s position in the region.</p>

                <p>Despite the Mongol invasions, Georgia managed to survive as a fragmented kingdom. The Georgians
                    resisted the Mongols and attempted to retain control of their land and culture. The kingdom was
                    divided into separate principalities during this period, weakening Georgia’s political unity and its
                    capacity to defend against further external threats.</p>

                <p>The Mongol invasions, along with the weakening of the Georgian aristocracy and the external pressures
                    of neighboring empires, led to a decline in Georgia’s power and territorial control. However,
                    despite these hardships, Georgia retained its cultural and religious identity, setting the stage for
                    future resistance against foreign domination.</p>

            <h2>Georgia Under Foreign Domination: The Ottoman Empire and Persia</h2>

            <img src="https://www.ancient.eu/uploads/images/11841.png?v=1580895749" alt="" width="500">

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>From the 16th century onwards, Georgia was caught in a geopolitical struggle between the Ottoman
                    Empire and the Persian Empire. Both powers sought to control Georgia due to its strategic location.
                    This period of foreign domination weakened Georgia further, as the kingdom was divided into smaller
                    principalities, many of which were controlled by either the Ottomans or the Persians. Despite this,
                    Georgia’s Orthodox Christian faith and cultural identity were preserved.</p>

                <p>The strategic location of Georgia on the border between the Ottoman and Persian empires made it a key
                    battleground. The Georgian aristocracy often found themselves at odds with both powers. Despite the
                    pressure, the Georgians fiercely resisted, trying to maintain their independence and sovereignty
                    while also struggling to preserve their unique identity and Orthodox Christian religion.</p>

                <p>During this period, Georgia faced multiple invasions and internal strife. The northern regions of
                    Georgia fell under Russian influence, and the southern parts were controlled by the Ottoman Empire,
                    leading to deep political divisions. The period of foreign domination, while difficult, also
                    fostered a sense of resilience among the Georgian people, which would later inspire their desire for
                    independence.</p>

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>In the early 19th century, the Kingdom of Georgia sought protection from the Russian Empire, which
                    eventually led to its annexation in 1801. While Russian rule provided some stability, it also
                    suppressed Georgian independence and cultural identity. However, the Georgian people continued to
                    resist, and after the fall of the Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence in 1918.</p>
                    
                <p>Georgia’s annexation into the Russian Empire in the early 19th century marked the beginning of a new
                    phase in Georgian history. While Russia helped Georgia fend off foreign invasions, it also sought to
                    control and integrate the country into the empire. Georgia's desire for independence remained
                    strong, as the people resisted Russian policies that threatened their unique culture and identity.
                </p>

                <p>Following the collapse of the Russian Empire after World War I, Georgia briefly enjoyed independence
                    between 1918 and 1921, until the Soviet Union occupied it. Despite this brief period of
                    independence, the spirit of Georgian resistance to foreign control would continue throughout the
                    20th century, culminating in Georgia’s modern independence in 1991.</p>

            <img src="http://www.dcstamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RUS-Georgia-Rep-Map.jpg" alt="" width="500">

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>Following a brief period of independence after World War I, Georgia was incorporated into the Soviet
                    Union in 1922. Under Soviet rule, Georgia experienced significant political, economic, and social
                    changes. The Soviet regime attempted to suppress Georgian nationalism, but the people retained their
                    unique cultural identity. Despite these challenges, Georgia contributed significantly to Soviet
                    industry and culture.</p>

                <p>During the Soviet period, Georgia faced intense political repression, but the Georgian people managed
                    to preserve their language and culture despite attempts to suppress them. While Georgia’s economy
                    was integrated into the Soviet system, the people of Georgia maintained strong ties to their
                    Orthodox Christian faith and traditional customs.</p>

                <p>However, the Soviet Union’s policies of centralization and Russification had a lasting impact on
                    Georgia’s political landscape. The desire for independence grew throughout the 20th century, and in
                    1991, Georgia declared its sovereignty as the Soviet Union collapsed, marking the beginning of its
                    modern history as an independent nation.</p>

            <div class="section-text">

                <p>Georgia declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, following the collapse of the USSR.
                    The country faced numerous challenges, including economic instability, territorial disputes, and
                    conflicts with Russia over regions such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Despite these difficulties,
                    Georgia has made significant strides in its development, seeking closer integration with the West
                    through aspirations to join the European Union and NATO.</p>

                <p>The 1990s were a turbulent time for Georgia, as the country struggled to establish a stable
                    government. Conflicts with Russia, economic hardships, and internal divisions marked this period.
                    However, Georgia’s pursuit of democratic reforms and integration into the global community helped
                    the country recover and modernize in the early 21st century.</p>

                <p>Modern Georgia is a vibrant and growing country with a rich cultural heritage and a strong desire for
                    independence and sovereignty. The country has taken significant steps toward European integration,
                    and its future looks bright as it continues to navigate the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
