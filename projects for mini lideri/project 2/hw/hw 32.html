        <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara PÃ¶lzl. His early life was marked by a difficult relationship with his father and the death of his younger siblings. Hitler's father was strict, and Adolf was often rebellious, which caused tension between them. He was also very close to his mother, who doted on him and supported his artistic ambitions. However, his artistic dreams were crushed when he was rejected twice by the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. During this time, Hitler became increasingly bitter and isolated, eventually developing a strong interest in politics and German nationalism.</p>
        <p>Hitler moved to Munich in 1913, where he struggled to make a living. He lived in poverty and relied on social welfare programs. World War I broke out in 1914, and Hitler enlisted in the Bavarian Reserve Infantry. He served as a messenger on the Western Front and was wounded twice during the war. It was during this period that Hitler's deep nationalist and anti-Semitic views began to form, as he came to blame Jews and communists for Germany's defeat in the war.</p>

        <h2>Political Rise</h2>
        <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140828132531-02-world-war-ii-0828.jpg?q=w_2000,h_1125,x_0,y_0,c_fill/h_618" alt="Hitler Political Rise"width="500">
        <p>After World War I, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919, which later became the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or Nazi Party. He quickly became the party's most charismatic and influential leader. In 1923, Hitler and his followers attempted a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. He was arrested and sentenced to prison, where he wrote his manifesto, Mein Kampf. In this book, Hitler outlined his vision for Germany's future, including his views on Aryan racial superiority, anti-Semitism, and his desire for territorial expansion.</p>
        <p>After his release from prison, Hitler focused on expanding the Nazi Party and gaining support from the German population. The global economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s played a significant role in his rise to power, as many Germans were dissatisfied with the Weimar Republic and the economic instability. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg. Once in power, Hitler moved quickly to establish a totalitarian regime, using propaganda, intimidation, and violence to eliminate political opposition and consolidate power.</p>

        <h2>World War II</h2>
        <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140828132531-01-world-war-ii-0828.jpg?q=w_4018,h_2260,x_0,y_0,c_fill/w_1280" width="500">
        <p>Under Hitler's leadership, Germany began a campaign of territorial expansion. In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, sparking the outbreak of World War II. Hitler's aggressive foreign policies aimed at overturning the Treaty of Versailles, which had imposed heavy reparations on Germany after World War I. In addition to the invasion of Poland, Germany invaded France, the Soviet Union, and other countries in Europe. The war resulted in massive loss of life, with millions of civilians and military personnel killed.</p>
        <p>One of Hitler's most notorious policies was the Holocaust, the systematic genocide of six million Jews, as well as millions of others, including Romani people, disabled individuals, and political dissidents. The Nazis also targeted homosexuals and other groups deemed undesirable. The Holocaust remains one of the darkest chapters in human history.</p>
        <p>By 1945, the Allies had closed in on Germany from all sides. With Berlin surrounded and the German military in retreat, Hitler retreated to his underground bunker in Berlin. On April 30, 1945, as Soviet forces closed in on the city, Hitler committed suicide along with his wife, Eva Braun. His death marked the end of the Nazi regime and the collapse of Nazi Germany.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/116AE/production/_92124317_hitlermodelap27ok.jpg" width="750">
        <p>Adolf Hitler's legacy is one of destruction and suffering. His actions led to the deaths of millions of people and the devastation of much of Europe. The Holocaust is remembered as one of the greatest atrocities in human history, and Hitler's ideology of racial superiority and hatred remains a powerful reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and racism. In the aftermath of the war, the world sought to ensure that such a tragedy would never happen again, leading to the formation of the United Nations and the Nuremberg Trials, which sought to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.</p>
        <p>Hitler's rise to power and the events of World War II also had far-reaching consequences on the global political landscape. The war led to the division of Europe into two spheres of influence, with the Soviet Union and the United States emerging as superpowers. The Cold War, which lasted for much of the second half of the 20th century, was a direct result of the geopolitical shifts caused by Hitler's actions.</p>
        <p>In modern times, Adolf Hitler is viewed as a symbol of the dangers of unchecked power and the consequences of hatred and bigotry. His name is synonymous with evil and tyranny, and his legacy serves as a warning to future generations about the importance of democracy, tolerance, and human rights.</p>
