        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and
            philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of
            the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his
            publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across
            many music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized street dance moves such as the
            moonwalk, which he named, and the robot.</p>

        <p>He was the eighth child of the Jackson family, and made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers
            Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5
            signed with Motown in 1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael as lead singer. Jackson began his
            solo career in 1971 while at Motown and recorded multiple successful singles. He became a global solo star
            with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and
            "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the
            medium into an art form and promotional tool. He helped popularize MTV and continued to innovate with videos
            for his albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and
            Invincible (2001). Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce
            five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 1]

        <p>, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The
            lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was
            tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The Federal Bureau
            of Investigation found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson. In 2009, while he was preparing for a
            series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his
            personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for his involvement
            in Jackson's death. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of
            internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. Jackson's televised memorial service, held at the
            Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people.

            Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500 million
            records worldwide.[nb 2</p>

            Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[419] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[420] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the discontinuation of the album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel.[38][421]
            
            In songs such as "Black or White", "Heal the World", "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice.[422][423] He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.[424][425] Jackson has also appeared on Rolling Stone's lists of the Greatest Singers of All Time.[426][427] He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,[428] and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.[429][430][431]
            
            Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.
