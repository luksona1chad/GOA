        <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup
            consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist
            Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for
            the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon until
            Bennington's death by suicide in July 2017, which caused the band to enter an indefinite hiatus. In
            September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.

        <h2>1996–2000: Foundation and early years</h2>
        <p>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.[7] The
            three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.[7] After graduating
            from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave
            "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in
            resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996,
            resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997.[7] That same month, the band
            performed their first show, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in
            West Hollywood.[8] Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R for Zomba Music, whom
            he had interned for in college.[9][10] Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention
            of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998 but
            believed the band needed a different vocalist.[9][10] Tensions and frustration within the band grew after
            they failed to land a record deal.[7] The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at
            that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.[7] Farrell also left to tour
            with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.[11][12]</p>

        <p>Categorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy
            metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to
            international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by
            the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the
            album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling", and "In the End" all
            charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on
            the nation's Billboard Hot 100.[2] Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.[3] The
            band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[4] By the end of the
            decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.[</p>
