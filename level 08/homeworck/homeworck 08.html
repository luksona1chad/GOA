<p>Chad is an online slang term for a sexually active " alpha male " . </p>
<p>The term is used in incel forums and menosphere groups. Among teenagers, it is a slang term for a particularly brave and competent male. [1] [2]</p>
<p>The term originated in Chicago [3] and originally carried a pejorative connotation to refer to a young urban American male, usually single, in his twenties or early thirties. [4]</p>

<p>The term is used on incel forums to refer to sexually active "alpha males". [5] Those with the highest results in genetic fitness are considered to enter the menosphere . </p>
<p>In Menosphere's online animation, Chad is often tagged with the moniker Thundercock and is depicted as masculine, with prominent crotch bulges. </p>
<p>One such image, the meme of 2010 - "Virgin vs. Chad" or the so-called "Virgin Walk" is where a character with low self-esteem, often alternatively referred to as a "beta" or "omega" male, is compared to Chad. In Internet memes, Chad's head is depicted in the form of the country of the same name . This image is reminiscent of the American fashion stereotypes of the 1980s and is somewhat consistent with the stereotypical Jock. [6] Chads are a genetically endowed and privileged category—superficial, headstrong, and overtly sexualized [7] —the term Chad is used both peroratively and in a complimentary way on incel forums.
