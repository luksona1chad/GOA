        <p>The Unix operating system was conceived of and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs in the United States, by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.[58] First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly
            language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973, in a key pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (except for some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation
            of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.[59]</p>

        <p>From 1999, the project leader was elected yearly.[30] The number of applicants was overwhelming and the project established the new member process.[31][32] The package manager front-end APT was deployed with Debian 2.1.[18] The first Debian derivatives,
            namely Libranet,[33] Corel Linux and Stormix's Storm Linux, were started in 1999.[20] The 2.2 release in 2000 was dedicated to Joel Klecker, a developer who had recently died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[34]
