        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <p>The Unix operating system was conceived of and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs in the United States, by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.[58] 
           First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. 
           In 1973, in a key pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (except for some hardware and I/O routines). 
           The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.[59]</p>

        <h2>Debian</h2>
        <p>From 1999, the Debian project leader was elected yearly.[30] 
           The number of applicants was overwhelming, and the project established a new member process.[31][32] 
           The package manager front-end APT was deployed with Debian 2.1.[18] 
           The first Debian derivatives, namely Libranet,[33] Corel Linux, and Stormix's Storm Linux, were started in 1999.[20] 
           The 2.2 release in 2000 was dedicated to Joel Klecker, a developer who had recently died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[34]</p>

        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>From 1985, the project leader for Windows was elected yearly.[35] 
           The number of applicants was overwhelming, and the project established a new member process.[36] 
           The first Windows derivatives were started around this time, though specific examples were not mentioned in the text.[37]</p>
