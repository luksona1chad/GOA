        <h2>Political Rise</h2>

            alt="Hitler Political Rise" width="500">
        <p>After World War I, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919, which later became the National Socialist
            German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or Nazi Party. He quickly became the party's most charismatic and influential
            leader. In 1923, Hitler and his followers attempted a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. He was
            arrested and sentenced to prison, where he wrote his manifesto, Mein Kampf. In this book, Hitler outlined
            his vision for Germany's future, including his views on Aryan racial superiority, anti-Semitism, and his
            desire for territorial expansion.</p>
        <p>After his release from prison, Hitler focused on expanding the Nazi Party and gaining support from the German
            population. The global economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s played a significant role in
            his rise to power, as many Germans were dissatisfied with the Weimar Republic and the economic instability.
            In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg. Once in power, Hitler
            moved quickly to establish a totalitarian regime, using propaganda, intimidation, and violence to eliminate
            political opposition and consolidate power.</p>

        <h2>World War II</h2>
        <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140828132531-01-world-war-ii-0828.jpg?q=w_4018,h_2260,x_0,y_0,c_fill/w_1280"
            width="500">
        <p>Under Hitler's leadership, Germany began a campaign of territorial expansion. In 1939, Germany invaded
            Poland, sparking the outbreak of World War II. Hitler's aggressive foreign policies aimed at overturning the
            Treaty of Versailles, which had imposed heavy reparations on Germany after World War I. In addition to the
            invasion of Poland, Germany invaded France, the Soviet Union, and other countries in Europe. The war
            resulted in massive loss of life, with millions of civilians and military personnel killed.</p>
        <p>One of Hitler's most notorious policies was the Holocaust, the systematic genocide of six million Jews, as
            well as millions of others, including Romani people, disabled individuals, and political dissidents. The
            Nazis also targeted homosexuals and other groups deemed undesirable. The Holocaust remains one of the
            darkest chapters in human history.</p>
        <p>By 1945, the Allies had closed in on Germany from all sides. With Berlin surrounded and the German military
            in retreat, Hitler retreated to his underground bunker in Berlin. On April 30, 1945, as Soviet forces closed
            in on the city, Hitler committed suicide along with his wife, Eva Braun. His death marked the end of the
            Nazi regime and the collapse of Nazi Germany.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>

        <p>Adolf Hitler's legacy is one of destruction and suffering. His actions led to the deaths of millions of
            people and the devastation of much of Europe. The Holocaust is remembered as one of the greatest atrocities
            in human history, and Hitler's ideology of racial superiority and hatred remains a powerful reminder of the
            dangers of totalitarianism and racism. In the aftermath of the war, the world sought to ensure that such a
            tragedy would never happen again, leading to the formation of the United Nations and the Nuremberg Trials,
            which sought to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.</p>
        <p>Hitler's rise to power and the events of World War II also had far-reaching consequences on the global
            political landscape. The war led to the division of Europe into two spheres of influence, with the Soviet
            Union and the United States emerging as superpowers. The Cold War, which lasted for much of the second half
            of the 20th century, was a direct result of the geopolitical shifts caused by Hitler's actions.</p>
        <p>In modern times, Adolf Hitler is viewed as a symbol of the dangers of unchecked power and the consequences of
            hatred and bigotry. His name is synonymous with evil and tyranny, and his legacy serves as a warning to
            future generations about the importance of democracy, tolerance, and human rights.</p>
