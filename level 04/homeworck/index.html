<h1>White-faced capuchin</h1>
<p>White-faced capuchin, or white headed capuchin, can refer to either of two species of gracile capuchin monkey:[1]</p>
<p>Cebus imitator, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Panamanian white-headed capuchin or Central American white-faced capuchin</p>
<h2>informate </h2>
<p>Cebus capucinus, the Colombian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Colombian white-headed capuchin</p>
<p>There are 2 subspecies of Colombian white-headed capuchin:[1]</p>
<p> imitator has a range in Central America, in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.[1] The range of C. capucinus is primarily in South America, in western Colombia and northwest Ecuador, although its range extends into the easternmost portion of Panama</p>
<h3>countrise</h3>
<p> curtus has a range restricted to Gorgona Island, while C. c. capucinus covers the remainder of the C. capucinus range.[1]</p>
<p>The two species differ slightly in appearance. Both are smallish monkeys which have black bodies, tails and limbs, with white faces, throats, chests and shoulders.</p>
<p>But females of C. imitator have brownish or grayish elongated frontal tufts which are lacking in C. capucinus</p>
<p>mitator had been regarded as a subspecies of C. capucinus until genetic studies in the 2010s revealed that the two species separated as much as 2 million years ago.</p>

<p>Although the Colombian white-headed capuchin retained the scientific name C.capucinus from prior to the species being split, almost all previous research on white-faced capuchins under the name C.</p>
<p>capucinus had actually been on the Central American species C. imitator as there have not been any field studies on the South American species.[4]</p>





<h1>Anime</h1>
<p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan.</p>
<p>Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.</p>
<p>Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.</p>
<h2>The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917</h2>
<p> A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.</p>
<p>Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.[2]</p>
<h3>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[3]</h3>
<p>Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[3]</p>
<p>Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[4]</p>
<h2>The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G, and Toei Animation. </h2>
<p>Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s due to the rise of streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide.[5]</p>
<p>As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.[6]</p>
<h4>Etymology</h4>
<img src="https://www.artezetastudio.it/up/anime.jpg" alt="">
<p>As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself.[7]</p>
<p>In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin.[8]</p>
<h5>The etymology of the term anime is disputed.</h5>
<p>The English word "animation" is written in Japanese katakana as アニメーション (animēshon) and as アニメ (anime, pronounced [a.ɲi.me] ⓘ) in its shortened form.[12</p>
<p>Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation dessin animé ("cartoon", literally 'animated drawing'),[13] but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late 1970s and 1980s.[12]</p>
<p>n English, anime—when used as a common noun—normally functions as a mass noun. (For example:) </p>
<h6>Do you watch anime?" or "How much anime have you watched?"[14][15] </h6>
<p>As with a few other Japanese words, such as saké and Pokémon, English texts sometimes spell anime as animé (as in French), with an acute accent over the final e, to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as English orthography may suggest.</p>
<p> Prior to the widespread use of anime, the term Japanimation, a portmanteau of Japan and animation, was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term anime began to supplant Japanimation;[16] </p>
<p> in general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.[17]</p>

<h1>The polar bear </h1>
<p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. </p>
<p> The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). </p>
<p>The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. </p>
<h2>informate</h2>
<p> Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.</p>
<p>Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered to be marine mammals due to their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. </p>
<p>The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber. Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. </p>

<p>During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years.</p>
<p>The polar bear is considered to be a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change, pollution and energy development. </p>
<p>Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice, giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. </p>
<h4>etymology</h4>
<p>Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with people. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture.</p>
<p>The polar bear was given its common name by Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771). It was known as the "white bear" in Europe between the 13th and 18th centuries, as well as "ice bear", "sea bear" and "Greenland bear". </p>
<p>The Norse referred to it as isbjørn 'ice bear' and hvitebjørn 'white bear'. The bear is called nanook by the Inuit. The Netsilik cultures additionally have different names for bears based on certain factors, such as sex and age: these include adult males (anguraq), single adult females (tattaq), gestating females (arnaluk), newborns (hagliaqtug), large adolescents (namiaq) and dormant bears (apitiliit).</p>
<h5>The scientific name Ursus maritimus is Latin for 'sea bear'.[6][7]</h5>
<p>Carl Linnaeus classified the polar bear as a type of brown bear (Ursus arctos), labelling it as Ursus maritimus albus-major, articus in the 1758 edition of his work Systema Naturae.[8]</p>
<p>Constantine John Phipps formally described the polar bear as a distinct species, Ursus maritimus in 1774, following his 1773 voyage towards the North Pole.[4][9] Due to its adaptations to a marine environment, some taxonomists like Theodore Knottnerus-Meyer have placed the polar bear in its genus Thalarctos.[10][11]</p>
<p> However Ursus is widely considered to be the valid genus for the species based on the fossil record and the fact that it can breed with the brown bear.[11][12]</p>
<h4>Different subspecies have been proposed including Ursus maritimus maritimus and U. m. marinus.[a][13]</h4>
<p>However these are not supported and the polar bear is considered to be monotypic.[14] One possible fossil subspecies, U. m. tyrannus, was posited in 1964 by Björn Kurtén, who reconstructed the subspecies from a single fragment of an ulna which was approximately 20 percent larger than expected for a polar bear.[12] </p>
<p>However, re-evaluation in the 21st century has indicated that the fragment likely comes from a giant brown bear.[15][16]</p>
