<h1>Teimuraz I</h1>
<p>In 1604 , Russian ambassadors tried to send Teimuraz to Russia as a groom for Boris Godunov's wife [1] . </p>
<p>In the same year Giorgi Batonishvili sent Teimuraz and his sister Ketevani to the Shah.</p>
<p>The shah received Teimuraz warmly, in the words of monk Egnatashvili , "as if the son was so sweet."</p>
<p>According to Archiliani, Teimuraz was accompanied by Shermazan Cholokashvili , who taught morality, trained him in divine and secular knowledge, and strengthened his inner strength.</p>
<h2>King coronation</h2>
<p>The Kakheti rebellion of 1605 forced the Shah to make concessions. In 1606 , he approved the 16-year-old Christian Teimuraz as the king of Kakheti, but held the ceremony of consecration of the Georgian king in Iran.</p>
<p>Iskander Munshi describes the consecration of Teimuraz as king by Shah-Abbas as follows:</p>
<p>"Georgians spread the carpet of rule for him according to the rule and law of that royal family, and Teimuraz-Khan stood on that carpet by the order and instructions of the powerful and happy ruler. Georgians took pots with money in their hands and wanted to sprinkle it on his head. </p>
<p>His majesty, when he got to know this manner and manners of theirs, out of his great mercy, ordered that I should be the first to put the money on his head.</p>
<p>When his majesty had sprinkled the gold and precious stones, the illustrious amirs and the attendants of the garden-like feast followed suit, and each performed the custom of throwing them on his head befitting his rank and honor. </p>
<p>The nobles of Georgians also threw gold and silver money on his head and according to the established law, they gave him a trophy and took the trophy away (from Teimuraz). </p>
<p>On that day, in order to cheer up the mind and think, they spread Lkhini diapers and laughed with those people (Georgians), whose singing and speech were foreign things" [2] .</p>
<h3>Shah-Abbas placed great hopes on Teimuraz. </h3>
<p>According to Shah, Teimraz, brought up on Persian culture and the best connoisseur of Persian literature and poetry, should have been a supporter of Persian orientation in Georgia.</p>
<p>Teimuraz left for his homeland, decorated in ceremonial fashion. Ketevan happily accepted his son. The young king Bodbe was blessed. The kingdom was actually ruled by the Ketevan queen.</p>
<p>In the same spring of 1606, Shah-Abbas approved the 14-year-old Luarsab, the son of King Giorgis, who died suddenly, as the king of Kartli. He expelled the Ottomans from the Kartli fortresses (Lore, Agjakala, Dmanisi, Tbilisi) and put Metzikhovnei in Kizilba. The kingdoms of Kartli-Kakheti were considered vassals of Iran and were obliged to come out with troops on the side of Iran if necessary.</p>
<p>In 1607 , according to Iskander Munshi, Shah-Abbas left Kartli, entered Shemakha Castle and captured Teimuraz with army. The young king avoided an argument with the Shah and excused himself from the campaign. When the Shah summoned Teimuraz again, he was accompanied by the queen of Ketevan with a thousand-strong army. Shah-Abbas was offended, but did not notice. He received the queen with honor, but he did not give any work to the army.</p>
<h4>family</h4>
<p>In 1607 , on the initiative of Queen Ketevan and the advice of the nobles, Teimuraz I was married to Ana , the daughter of Mamiya Guriel . Teymuraz arranged a magnificent wedding for Torgha.</p>
<p>Lkhini and celebration continued for forty days. The young king spent his time happily, hunting and fishing. In the summer, he would go to Shuamta, Ertso, Tianeti for salkhin and saburtli, in the autumn he would come to Kakheti, feasting and laughing on the "Motherhood of God", "Alaverdo", "Crucifixion", "Easter". </p>
<p>I've been here for seven years, I don't have anything to say, painlessly and without difficulty, I don't even have nosebleeds," Archili tells Teimuraz.</p>
<p>Teimuraz had two children from Anna. According to the Paris Chronicle, "for the first time, Levan and Merme had Alexander." Princes appeared one after the other. In "Archilian" it is said: "I have grown up with two children, five years old and four years old."</p>
<p> Levan - the eldest son was born in 1609: "Kksa Szhz Aka Ishwa Dze Misi Levan" [3] . A year later, in 1610 , Alexander was also bought. Queen Anne died soon after in 1612 . The young king was greatly saddened by the death of his wife. According to Archil, Teimuraz sat in the dark for forty years and said bitterly:</p>
<h2>1612</h2>

<p>In 1612 , Teimuraz Shah was dressed in black. "And he welcomed Caen very well and gave him many sisters and brought him out of mourning," says monk Egnatashvili. Vakhushti repeats the same thing: "Mourning robbed, Anadimed and Anadim Maradgi"</p>
<p>According to Georgian sources, Shah-Abbas proposed to Teimuraz to marry Khoreshan, the sister of King Luarsab. "Shiretev and Luarsab of the king, and Ikmen of the stone, and loving him, so that there is no envy between you," writes Vakhushti. Monk Egnatashvili and Archil repeat the same thing.</p>
<p>Teimuraz was greatly disturbed by this news, because Khoreshan was his close relative. Khoreshan's grandmother Nestan-Darejani was the sister of Teimurazi's grandfather Alexander. </p>
<p>The refusal did not pass and Teimuraz agreed. According to Beri Egnatashvili and Vakhushti, Kaen wrote to Luarsab to give it to Teimuraz, but Luarsab did not follow his word and Teimuraz joined Khoreshan. But this marriage took place after Teimuraz became "legal". "</p>
<p> "The patriarch and the bishop held a meeting and a council, in order to strengthen Christianity, they gave permission to Mr. Teimuraz and Khoreshan was taken by Mr. Teimuraz and joined," the Paris Chronicle tells us. This is also confirmed by Farsadan Gorgijanidze: "Mr.</p>
<p>Teimurazi's grandfather Mr. Alexander and Nestan Darejan, the grandmother of Khoreshan Dedofali, were brothers and sisters, they are Mr. Levan's children, and they were weak in Christianity, and Merjulen was also not willing, and there was a scandal for the son of Aragvi Eristav, and they are holding a meeting about this, so that they will fraternize their grandchildren to each other."</p>
<p> How to connect They chose Asre and allowed Merjule to unify and strengthen Christianity." Thus, the hall decided to request Khoreshan for Teimuraz. In addition to Shah-Abbas's request, the basis was the strengthening of Christianity. </p>
<p>ndeed, with this act, the forces of two kingdoms - Kartli and Kakheti were united, and thus it could be of great importance for the defense of the country. </p>
<p> Platon Yoselian thinks otherwise. In his opinion, the Shah was trying to shake the strength of the Christian Church with this act. Khoreshan was a relative of Teimuraz, and the Shah knew very well that they were forbidden to marry according to the rules of the Orthodox Church. The teachers of the church, the king and the people saw in advance the terrible intention of the shah, that the shah wanted to gradually undermine the strength of the Christians by violating the rules of the church, to bring the Georgians closer to the Muslims" [4] .</p>
<p>In 1612 , Teimuraz I married Khoreshan . According to Vakhushti, the wedding took place in Grem. "K~sa Chkib, Kar. T". According to Archil, Teimuraz seems satisfied with this marriage</p>
<p>In 1614 , in connection with his marriage to Khoreshan, King Teimuraz made a donation to the Church of the Mother of God in Metekhi: "I donate to you the monastery of Ujarmi, Sion, and the cauldrons of Khoraug... We brought Jamsa, the once-desired daughter of the king... Giorgis as a companion to us" [5] .</p>
<h5>Invasions of Shah-Abbas</h5>

<p>After the Iran-Ottoman peace of 1612 , the life of Georgians improved, but it did not last long. Shah-Abbas could not adapt to the terms of the truce, besides, he was not satisfied with the vassal attitude of the Kartl-Kakheti kingdoms, he was worried about the connection of the Georgians with Russia, and he decided to solve the Kartl-Kakheti issue once and for all in favor of Iran. According to Arakel Davrizhets, the Shah's main goal was to end the feud between the Georgian kings-principals in Georgia, to weaken them and finally subjugate the country.</p>
<p>The fourth volume of Essays on the History of Georgia states: " In the summer of 1612, Shah summoned Teimuraz and Luarsab to Mazandaran under the pretext of hunting" [6] . Actually, the summoning of the kings by the Shah should have taken place in the winter of 1613 . The kings hesitated, did not trust Shah and did not come to Mazandaran. </p>
<p>According to Iskander Munshi, "Amir-Quli Jilavdar, who brought them this good news, was stopped for a while by inventing various reasons; Each of them connected their departure with the departure of the other and asked for another time. </p>
<p>They shook themselves so much that it was already warm in Mazandaran, spring and hunting time had passed, and his majesty Shah also left this region. The mentioned Jilavdar was sent back empty-handed from Georgia and did not come to the Shah's court." Iskander Munshi continues and says that soon Shah Abbas punished the kings for this and on October 16, 1613 , he "went to Georgia for the holy war". Also, other sources confirm that the first campaign of Shah Abbas in Georgia took place in the fall of 1613 .</p>
<p>Shah-Abbas came to Ganja with a large army and demanded hostages from Teimuraz as a sign of loyalty and obedience, while spreading the word, I am going to fight against Ottomans. Teimuraz hesitated. He saw "there was no battle of the Ottomans" and knew the wickedness of Shah-Abbas, he did not want a successor. </p>
<p>The Kakheles insisted on sending their son. Then he sent his youngest son Alexander and accompanied his mother - Ketevani "he respects me more and doesn't hurt my son". Ketevan was received with honor by the Shah, but he was angry that I wanted the younger son, am I not a nanny? Teimuraz didn't want to send Levan and included the Queen of Ketevan - don't send him, but the Kakhelis didn't agree "don't kill Kakheti for one's servant". According to Archili's speech, Teimuraz begged the Kakhels:</p>
<h6>Rise of Teimuraz</h6>

<p>In 1629 , Shah-Abbas I died, in his stead, he ascended the Persian royal throne, who greatly reprimanded the Kartli king for the murder of Simeon II . Due to this, Teimuraz was forced to repay the Shah's resentment to Zurab , the main culprit in Simon's murder, by beheading himself. Teimuraz sent Zurab's head to Shah-Sefi and told him to kill Simon for the king's death. With this, Teimuraz earned the Shah's trust. In the words of Farsadan Gorgijanidze, the Shah liked this story, "they gave Kartlitsa and Kakheti to Teimuraz, and sent him a robe and a <p>
<p>Teimuraz considered it necessary to get closer to the king of Imereti, because he saw that Giorgi Saakadze tried to enthrone Alexander, the son of Giorgi, the king of Imereti, against him in Kartli. That's why Teimuraz betrothed his widowed daughter Darejani to Alexander, the son of the king of Imereti, who, for this marriage, betrayed his first wife, the daughter of Guriel, and let him go.</p>
<p>Since 1629 , Teimuraz has been the owner of the united Kartli-Kakheti throne. Orisav is reported as "throne holder" in "Archilian", "Orisav throne holder" and "king-king" are called in historical documents. At this time, according to Archil, the first period of Teimurazi's literary activity comes.</p>
<p>Teimuraz I recognized himself as a vassal of the Shah of Iran, but continued to fight for complete independence. In 1632 , Teimuraz and his brother-in-law Daud-Khan Undiladze raided the Ganja-Karabakh region and destroyed the territory of Arezsaketi.</p>
