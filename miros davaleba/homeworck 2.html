    <h2>API</h2>

    <p>The frontend communicates with backend through an API. In the case of web and mobile frontends, the API is often based on HTTP request/response. The API is sometimes designed using the "Backend for Frontend" (BFF) pattern, that serves responses to ease the processing on frontend side.[5]</p>
    <h3>Hardware definitions</h3>

    <p>In network computing, frontend can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic.[6] It is called application front-end hardware because it is placed on the network's outward-facing frontend or boundary. Network traffic passes through the front-end hardware before entering the network.</p>
    <p>In processor design, frontend design would be the initial description of the behavior of a circuit in a hardware description language such as Verilog, while backend design would be the process of mapping that behavior to physical transistors on a die.[7]</p>p
